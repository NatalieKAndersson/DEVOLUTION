# DEVOLUTION
Phylogenetic reconstruction from multiregional sampling data

## Installation instructions
Instructions


Try loading dataset "test". You should not get any error message.

## Usage

In order to illustrate the usage of the package, let's go through an example using the fabricated data set built into the software named "Segmentfile".

**Load the data**

What does the data set look like?

Describe the columns.

**Choose parameters**

You have to determine the following parameters.


**The event matrix**

Let us now make an event matrix using the fabricated data set.

DEVOLUTION()

Show an example of the event matrix and what it means.

**Let's produce the final event matrix**

What has the program done?

Table of sizes.

**Phylogenetic trees**

In the end one can use the event matrix in order to reconstruct a phylogenetic tree.
